# Import/Export Endpoints

## JSON Import/Export Endpoints

### GET /api/import/json
Exports database to JSON format for backup/migration.

**Authentication:** Librarian only

**Response:** ImportRequestDto containing:
- Libraries
- Authors
- Users (including hashed passwords)
- Books
- Loans
- **Photos:** NOT INCLUDED - photos are excluded due to size

**Important Notes:**
- Photos are intentionally excluded from JSON export to prevent response size issues
- Photo data should be managed separately via the Photo Export feature (`/api/photo-export`)
- The JSON export is designed for backing up metadata and structural data only
- Photo files are backed up to Google Photos via the separate photo export functionality

### POST /api/import/json
Imports database from JSON format.

**Authentication:** Librarian only

**Request Body:** ImportRequestDto (same structure as export)

**Behavior:**
- Merges data with existing records (doesn't delete existing data)
- Matches entities by natural keys (e.g., library name, author name, book title+author)
- Photos in the import file are processed but image bytes are not expected
