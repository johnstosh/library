# Lessons Learned from Library Management System Development

One key lesson from developing this library management system was the importance of meticulously handling Content-Type headers in frontend API requests to avoid HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type errors. Initially, the frontend JavaScript fetch calls were sending requests with mismatched Content-Type headers, such as 'text/plain;charset=UTF-8' instead of the expected 'application/json' for JSON payloads, leading to server-side rejection by Spring Boot's @RequestBody deserialization. This highlighted the need for explicit header configuration in functions like postData and putData, ensuring 'Content-Type': 'application/json' is set only for non-FormData requests, while allowing the browser to auto-set 'multipart/form-data' for file uploads. Additionally, distinguishing between form-encoded login submissions (handled by Spring Security) and JSON API calls prevented similar issues in authentication flows. Thorough logging of request/response details in the browser console and server logs was invaluable for debugging, reinforcing the practice of implementing robust error handling and validation early in the development cycle to maintain a seamless user experience across CRUD operations, photo management, and role-based access control.
